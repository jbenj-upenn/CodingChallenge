# RockPaperScissor_CodingChallenge
As part of an interview, I was asked to create a game of RPS using Java.

The initial game was simple and certainly not optimized. After completing it and having it functional in a bare bones sense, I decided to add some features like: 

- user chooses how much to play until;
- user can opt to play again;
- ties do not ask user to press 1 to play again, they just make you do so;
- enhanced updates on the score, and upon winning or losing, the message "you are winning/losing ## to ##" does not appear.
